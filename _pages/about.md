Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at Boston University (BU). My research interests are **Corporate Finance**, **Capital Structure**, **ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)**. I am on the 2025-2026 job market.


## Job Market Paper
**Sustainability-linked Loans and Financial Benefits**

Using a sample of bank loans issued between 2016 and 2022, I find that firms issuing sustainability-linked loans
(SLLs) experience credit rating upgrades and higher post-issuance equity returns relative to firms issuing conventional
loans. To address potential endogeneity, I instrument SLL issuance with the EU Taxonomy and obtain
consistent estimates. Channel tests then indicate that these effects arise primarily through reduced financing
costs rather than investor-demand (signaling) channels. To rationalize the findings, I develop a model in which
firms choose between SLLs and conventional loans: SLLs offer lower coupons conditional on meeting sustainability
targets but incur issuance/verification and compliance costs. The model shows that the financing-cost reduction
alone is sufficient to generate the observed credit improvements and equity outperformance.

with _Zhiyao Chen_, _Dirk Hackbarth_, and _Jarrad Harford_

In the context of mergers and acquisitions, this paper analyzes a maturity overhang problem that is due to shorter
debt maturities creating higher rollover risk. Using bond transaction data, we develop a market-based measure of
rollover risk and find that i) rollover risk dampens merger activities at the firm and aggregate levels; ii) acquirers
facing higher rollover risk are more sensitive to changes in cash reserves and prefer equity as a payment method
over cash; and iii) positive market reactions to cash payment are observed only when firms have low rollover risk.
To shed light on our empirical findings, we study a dynamic investment model that underscores the importance
of precautionary savings and rollover risk for maturity overhang.

**Capital Structure and Environmental Risk**

with _Dirk Hackbarth_

We build a model in which firms incur additional costs to maintain their ESG status, and this status can potentially
attract more investors. That is, firms face the trade-off between the increased distress risk and the added demand
for their stocks from ESG-focused investors. In this setting, the impact of ESG ratings on the cost of equity can
be positive or negative. Notably, ESG status can increase the cost of equity for firms with high ESG maintenance
costs and high leverage. Furthermore, the net effect of ESG ratings on the cost of equity also depends on the
market demand for ESG-focused stocks. Finally, our model suggests firms that benefit from their ESG rating
use their lower cost of equity to issue more equity. In a large sample of US firms during the 2002–2022 period,
we find evidence consistent with the heterogeneous impacts of ESG rating on both the cost of equity and equity
issuance.
