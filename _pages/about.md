Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Finance at Boston University (BU). My research interests are **Corporate Finance**, **Capital Structure**, **ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance)**. I am on the 2025-2026 job market.


# Job Market Paper
## Sustainability-linked Loans and Financial Benefits

Using a sample of bank loans issued between 2016 and 2022, I find that firms issuing sustainability-linked loans
(SLLs) experience credit rating upgrades and higher post-issuance equity returns relative to firms issuing conventional
loans. To address potential endogeneity, I instrument SLL issuance with the EU Taxonomy and obtain
consistent estimates. Channel tests then indicate that these effects arise primarily through reduced financing
costs rather than investor-demand (signaling) channels. To rationalize the findings, I develop a model in which
firms choose between SLLs and conventional loans: SLLs offer lower coupons conditional on meeting sustainability
targets but incur issuance/verification and compliance costs. The model shows that the financing-cost reduction
alone is sufficient to generate the observed credit improvements and equity outperformance.

# Working Papers
## [Maturity Overhang: Evidence from M&A](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4280419)
with __Zhiyao Chen__, Dirk Hackbarth, and Jarrad Harford

In the context of mergers and acquisitions, this paper analyzes a maturity overhang problem that is due to shorter
debt maturities creating higher rollover risk. Using bond transaction data, we develop a market-based measure of
rollover risk and find that i) rollover risk dampens merger activities at the firm and aggregate levels; ii) acquirers
facing higher rollover risk are more sensitive to changes in cash reserves and prefer equity as a payment method
over cash; and iii) positive market reactions to cash payment are observed only when firms have low rollover risk.
To shed light on our empirical findings, we study a dynamic investment model that underscores the importance
of precautionary savings and rollover risk for maturity overhang.



Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
